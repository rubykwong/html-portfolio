<h2>Things to bear in mind</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Not many of my friends know each other! Please be friendly, and make an effort to get to know each other. It would make me very happy.</li>
    <li>I love presents, but I don't want them for the sake of it! If you've thought of something that you'd like to get me, I'd love that - but if not, don't sweat it.</li>
    <li>I'm feeling quite nervous about bringing people together, so if you can avoid cancelling at the last minute, I'd appreciate it.</li>
</ul>
