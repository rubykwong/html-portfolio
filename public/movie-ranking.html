<h1>The best films of all time, according to Ruby</h1>
<h2>I know, it's just my thoughts.</h2>

<h3>Anatomy of a Fall</h3>
<p>I haven't been able to get this film out of my mind since watching it. It is so entrancing, and takes what you think might be a whodunnit/procedural and turns it into a stunning exploration of the depth and nuance of marital relationships. Sandra Huller is amazing in it.</p>
<h3>Robot Dreams</h3>
<p>How could I not? Seems like a kids' film, but is actually all about the end of relationships, and the beginning of new ones. </p>
<h3>Tomboy</h3>
<p>This one I'm not even that sure about, but I loved it when I watched it, and I wanted a bit of range in this selection. Really moving, and touched me personally.</p>
